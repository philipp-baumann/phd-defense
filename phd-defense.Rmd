.right-column[
- Provide a tool to **rapidly identify** and understand **soil fertility constraints** to yam production for new soils in the project regions:
  - .e.g., to better derive **context specific** nutrient recommendations
  
  - **cover the typical variation** in soil properties
  
  - **verify** the **soil quality effects** of innovative management options

.left-column[
 **.red[Main objectives and research questions:]**
]

.right-column[
- Build a **harmonized mid-IR SSL for Switzerland**
   - based on **spatial soil variation** from geographical grid observations of the Biodiversity Monitoring (BDM) program and **spatio-temporal soil information** from agricultural sites of the Swiss Soil Monitoring network (NABO).
- How reliable is **rule-based modeling** to extract general estimates for **16 key soil properties** with separate regressions from all available data?
- How and how accurately can data-driven **"SSL-to-plot" transfer workflows** reproduce **soil changes at individual monitoring locations**?
  - How useful is a **medium sized and diverse SSL** for **systematic soil monitoring**?

- **Sustainable soil management practices**:
  - Maintain or increase levels of **soil organic matter and soil organic carbon stocks** in farmlands
  
- Frick trial of the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL):
  - **Significant changes in organic carbon levels at 0â€”20cm between 2002 and 2018**
  
  - Main increase of OC contents: **reduced tillage** treatments.


<br>
- **Soil sensing and SSLs** effectively detect changes in soil organic carbon
  - **bias-variance tradeoff:** any more measurements; slightly less accurate; relatively unbiased
      - Trajectory in SOC over time: oil variability over small ranges and over larger extents
      
- **Drastically minimize analytical measurements** for soil monitoring and verification

# **Chapter 3:** Detecting management induced changes in soil organic carbon at the plot level with mid-infrared spectroscopy

.left-column[
**.red[Main objectives and research questions]**
]

.right-column[
- What is the accuracy of point estimates and the accuracy of changes with mid-IR spectroscopy and all samples
- What is an **effective workflow** to conduct **plot level transfer for a long-term experimental site** so that only **minimal amounts of new local laboratory analytical measurements** are needed to **complement and extract existing knowledge from SSLs**?
- Is similarity-driven or performance-driven transfer learning better to **improve the tradeoff of accuracy vs. adaptation requirements for soil monitoring**?
