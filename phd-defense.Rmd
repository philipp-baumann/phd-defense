.right-column[
- Mid-infrared spectroscopy has **.lgreen[opportunities]** and **.red[limitations]**:

  - **.lgreen[Good performance:]** Key soil properties such as <br> **organic carbon**, **total N**, **pH**, **cation exchange capacity**, **texture**, **clay minerals**, **carbonates**
      - Clear relationships of soil properties to mineral and organic soil composition
      
  - **.red[Poor or limited performance:]**<br> Extraction methods for agronomic diagnostics such as <br> **available macronutrients (phosphorus, potassium)** and **micronutrients (zinc)** 
      - **Complex exchange processes**<br> between soil solution and mineral and organic surfaces
      
      - **Higher data densities** over regional and farm extents; **transfer modeling**
      - Use also **other proxy methods** <br> (i.e. laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy; X-ray diffraction)

# Conclusions

.left-column[
**.blue[Transfer learning]**
]

.right-column[
- **Optimization** of large training sets towards new target soil samples/applications:

  - **.blue[Workflow]**: **how** soil data is **presented** to **algorithms** **.blue[matters]**
  
  - **.blue[Representativeness:]** sample the spectroscopic **space evenly** with **spectra** and **statistical methods** (i.e., distance and/or dissimilarity): 
  
      - **Validation samples** are *a must* (i.e, 2% to 5% analytical measurements).
      - **Adaptation samples** (i.e., 2% to 5% analytical measurements)
      - **Test/prediction samples** are the *scaling benefits* from spectroscopic workflows. (90 to 95%).
<br>
- We need **.blue[Continuous updating of SSLs]** and **.blue[transfer learning]**<br>with soil chemical and linked spectroscopic diversity:

      - To **reduce analytical measurements** in new monitoring sites and mapped soil regions
  
      - Using **data-driven modeling** (i.e., rs-local selection) to **extract relevant relationships**<br>between infrared spectra and measured properties.
