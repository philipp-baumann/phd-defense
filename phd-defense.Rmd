# **Chapter 1:** Estimation of soil properties with mid-infrared soil spectroscopy across yam production landscapes in West Africa

.left-column[
**.blue[ Background: ]**
]

.right-column[
- Increasing **land use frequencies** and **shorter fallow periods** in the **"yam belt" of West Africa**
- Importance of **soil organic matter** for soil quality: 
  - storage capacity and availability of essential plant nutrients

# **Chapter 1:** Estimation of soil properties with mid-infrared soil spectroscopy across yam production landscapes in West Africa

.left-column[
**.lgreen[Aims:]**
]

.right-column[
- Provide a tool to **rapidly identify** and understand **soil fertility constraints** to yam production for new soils in the project regions:
  - .e.g., to better derive **context specific** nutrient recommendations for yam in **four different** yam-growing **soil ecoregions** in Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso (timing, placement, form of fertilizer)
  - **cover the typical variation** in soil properties for yam-growing areas:  soils from 80 fields of smallholder farmers; climatic gradient between humid forest and northern Guinean savanna
  - **verify** the **soil quality effects** of sustainable and innovative soil and crop management options

# **Chapter 1:** Estimation of soil properties with mid-infrared soil spectroscopy across yam production landscapes in West Africa

.left-column[
**.red[ Main objectives and research questions: ]**
]

.right-column[
- **Develop and assess mid-IR spectroscopy models** to estimate soil properties that describe inherent soil fertility and control nutrient availability.
- What is the **potential** and what are the the **limitations** of **spectroscopic soil diagnostics** for discriminating landscape level and farm specific soil variability for agronomic purposes?

# **Chapter 2:** Developing the Swiss mid-infrared soil spectral library for local estimation and monitoring

.left-column[
 **.red[Main objectives and research questions:]**
]

.right-column[
- Build a **harmonized mid-IR SSL for Switzerland**
   - based on **spatial soil variation** from geographical grid observations of the Biodiversity Monitoring (BDM) program and **spatio-temporal soil information** from agricultural sites of the Swiss Soil Monitoring network (NABO).
- How reliable is **rule-based modeling** to extract general estimates for **16 key soil properties** with separate regressions from all available data?
- How and how accurately can data-driven **"SSL-to-plot" transfer workflows** reproduce **soil changes at individual monitoring locations**?
  - How useful is a **medium sized and diverse SSL** for **systematic soil monitoring**?

# **Chapter 3:** Sustainable soil management practices are expected to maintain or increase levels of soil organic matter and soil organic carbon stocks in farmlands

.right-column[
- **Sustainable soil management practices** are expected to **maintain or increase levels of soil organic matter and soil organic carbon stocks** in farmlands
- The Frick trial of the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL) has shown **significant changes in organic carbon levels at 0â€”20cm between 2002 and 2018**, whereby main increase of OC contents was in the **reduced tillage** treatments.


- **Soil sensing and SSLs** provides faster and highly cost-effective means to detect changes in soil organic carbon
- **bias-variance tradeoff:** with many more but slightly less accurate measurements we can **more effectively detect** the trajectory in SOC over time and at a resolution of small-range soil variation
- Do **as few as necessary analytical measurements** for long-term experiments and soil monitoring sites

# **Chapter 3:** Sustainable soil management practices are expected to maintain or increase levels of soil organic matter and soil organic carbon stocks in farmlands

.left-column[
**.red[Main objectives and research questions]**
]

.right-column[
- What is the accuracy of point estimates and the accuracy of changes with mid-IR spectroscopy and all samples
- What is an **effective workflow** to conduct **plot level transfer for a long-term experimental site** so that only **minimal amounts of new local laboratory analytical measurements** are needed to **complement and extract existing knowledge from SSLs**?
- Is similarity-driven or performance-driven transfer learning better to **improve the tradeoff of accuracy vs. adaptation requirements for soil monitoring**?
